The code defines a basic CPU and memory structure, along with functions for fetching, reading, writing, and manipulating data in memory and stack.

Key Components of Code:

Mem Structure: Represents the memory, containing a Data array of bytes to store data. It provides functions to read and write bytes at specific addresses.
StatusFlags Structure: Represents the CPU's status flags, which indicate the result of operations. It includes flags like Carry, Zero, Interrupt disable, Decimal mode, Break, Overflow, and Negative.

CPU Structure: Represents the CPU, containing the program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP), memory, registers (A, X, Y), and status flags. It defines various functions to interact with memory and the stack.

Fetch Functions: Fetch, FetchS, and FetchW retrieve data from memory based on the PC.

Read/Write Functions: RByte, RWord, WByte, and WWord read and write bytes and words (2 bytes) to specific memory addresses.

Stack Functions: GetSPAddress, PWtoS, PPCmtoS, PPCptoS, PPCtoS, PBontoS, PBfromS, and PWfromS manipulate the stack. They push and pop data from the stack, which is used for storing temporary values and function call parameters.

main Function: Demonstrates how to use the CPU functions, such as fetching, reading, writing, pushing to stack, and popping from stack.
